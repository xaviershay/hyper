//! # Hyper
//!
//! Hyper is a fast, modern HTTP implementation written in and for Rust. It
//! is a low-level typesafe abstraction over raw HTTP, providing an elegant
//! layer over "stringly-typed" HTTP.
//!
//! Hyper offers both a [Client](client/index.html) and a
//! [Server](server/index.html) which can be used to drive complex web
//! applications written entirely in Rust.
//!
//! ## Internal Design
//!
//! Hyper is designed as a relatively low-level wrapper over raw HTTP. It should
//! allow the implementation of higher-level abstractions with as little pain as
//! possible, and should not irrevocably hide any information from its users.
//!
//! ### Common Functionality
//!
//! Functionality and code shared between the Server and Client implementations
//! can be found in `src` directly - this includes `NetworkStream`s, `Method`s,
//! `StatusCode`, and so on.
//!
//! #### Methods
//!
//! Methods are represented as a single `enum` to remain as simple as possible.
//! Extension Methods are represented as raw `String`s. A method's safety and
//! idempotence can be accessed using the `safe` and `idempotent` methods.
//!
//! #### StatusCode
//!
//! Status codes are also represented as a single, exhaustive, `enum`. This
//! representation is efficient, typesafe, and ergonomic as it allows the use of
//! `match` to disambiguate known status codes.
//!
//! #### Headers
//!
//! Hyper's [header](header/index.html) representation is likely the most
//! complex API exposed by Hyper.
//!
//! Hyper's headers are an abstraction over an internal `HashMap` and provides a
//! typesafe API for interacting with headers that does not rely on the use of
//! "string-typing."
//!
//! Each HTTP header in Hyper has an associated type and implementation of the
//! `Header` trait, which defines an HTTP headers name as a string, how to parse
//! that header, and how to format that header.
//!
//! Headers are then parsed from the string representation lazily when the typed
//! representation of a header is requested and formatted back into their string
//! representation when headers are written back to the client.
